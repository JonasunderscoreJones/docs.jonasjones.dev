# Introduction

This mod runs a simple HTTP server alongside the minecraft server. The mod allows You to host websites and share files and Server Backups directly from your server without the need of a seperate server setup. Adjust the port and design your website.

It also has a powerful API allowing you to fetch server info about players and the server itself. More info on the APIâ€™s Wiki page

The http server has up to no performance impact on the server. For more information on the performance impact visit the [Performance](/mcwebserver/performance) page.


:::warning WARNING: Use at your own risk!

If used wrongly this mod can be a security risk for your server and all devices connected to the network that your server is in.

Do only put files into your webservers root directory that you want to be accessible to the internet. Those files are public to the entire world.
