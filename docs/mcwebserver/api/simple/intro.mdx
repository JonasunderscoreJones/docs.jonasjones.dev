# Introduction

This API allows for gather the most surface-level information about a minecraft server.

All API calls have the prefix `/api/v1/` and are GET requests.

The supported API calls are:



## GET /api/v1/playernames
Get a list of all players that are currently online on the server

:::tip[**Example** Response]
```json
[
    {
        "ID": "c888eef5-edb7-4ceb-bbf3-987731de9747",
        "NAME": "Jonas_Jones"
    }
]
```
:::

| Parameter | Type   | Description                  |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| ID        | String | The UUID of the player       |
| NAME      | String | The name of the player       |

:::note

Versions \<`v0.3.0` returns an additional `LEGACY` field or every player that states whether or not the account is a legacy account or not.
