# r/kpop Comebacks Fetcher
View this script on [GitHub](https://github.com/JonasunderscoreJones/turbo-octo-potato/blob/main/rpopfetch.py)

This script fetches the K-Pop comebacks (new releases) data from the `r/kpop` subreddit wiki and converts it to json code. It also has an option to upload the json file using `rclone`

## Setup
The script requires a few environment variables to be set. For this, populate the `.env` file with the following variables:
```properties title="../.env"
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=[your reddit client ID]
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=[your reddit client secret]
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=[your reddit user agent]
```
For more info on how to get the `client id` and `client secret` go to the [Reddit API Docs](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)

## Usage
Inside the repository directory run the script by executing:
```bash
python rpopfetch.py [commandline arguments]
```

The script will output a json file with the data in the same directory as the script.

You will also have the option to add commandline arguments:
- Verbose Logging (`--verbose` or `-v`): This will print out more information about what the script is doing
- Upload to rclone (`--upload` or `-u`): This will upload the json file to the specified rclone remote and path. The remote and path are specified in the script itself.
