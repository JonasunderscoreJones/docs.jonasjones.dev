# Arch-Linux Setup
**A Guide To Install And Configure Arch-Linux The Way I like It (mostly for me to follow)**

## Why?
I often forget how to setup certain things and waste a lot of time re-googleing what I once already googled.

:::info
I have written an install-script that covers some of the steps described in this guide but only **some** and not all

The script is available at [JonasunderscoreJones/ArchSystemSetup](https://github.com/JonasunderscoreJones/ArchSystemSetup/) and can be run with the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://syssetup.jonasjones.dev | bash
```
It is strongly recommended to follow this guide and to **not** use this script.
:::

## Requirements
 - **Arch Linux**: Arch is technically required but most steps are almost identical on other distros, meaning that this guide can be followed for any distro (with a few exceptions)

## System Types
This guide is available for multiple types of systems.
