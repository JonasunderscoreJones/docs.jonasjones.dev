# Introduction

The API aims to provide a foundation for the different parts of the [Jonas_Jones Ecosystem](/jj_ecosystem) to interact with each other.

## Composition

The APi features 2 parts, the [front-end](#front-end) and the [back-end](#back-end)

### Front-End

A cloudflare worker available on [Github](https://github.com/JonasunderscoreJones/api-worker/) that routes the traffic to the [back-end](#back-end) and has a route for the API's uptime status:

- GET **/status** - Get API uptime status
:::tip[Response]
<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="200" label="200">
```json
API is up and running
{
    "status": 200,
    "statusText": "Ok"
}
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="503" label="503">
```json
API is down
{
    "status": 503,
    "statusText": "Service Unavailable"
}
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
:::

### Back-End

:::info

The Back-End is only available when the `/status` route returns code `200`

In theory this should always be the case but it is not guaranteed. Downtime can occur from time to time.

:::

A Rust back-end available on [Github](https://github.com/JonasunderscoreJones/jonas_jones-api) that handles all the forwarded requests from the [front-end](#front-end). The API is currently in it's first version therefore all routes start with `/v1/`. The routes are referenced on the [v1 Routes](/category/v1-routes) page.
