# BetterConsleMC

BetterConsoleMC is availabe on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/betterconsolemc) and [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betterconsolemc)

This mod allows for simple ingame command creation to allow for system command execution trough a player on the server.

This mod can be looked at as version 2.0 of [ConsoleMC](https://github.com/JonasunderscoreJones/ConsoleMC) which while being powerful enough, has a big security flaw whe used on big and/or public servers in a way that everyone (that is OP) can run any command on the MC server's host system, giving anyone access to the entire machine and allowing for bad actions to be taken by people who shouldn't have access to it.

## Config Files

BetterConsoleMC has two config files

### betterconsolemc-config.properties

```properties title="config/betterconsolemc-config.properties"
bettercmd.enable = true
```
| Config Key       | Description              | Default |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ------- |
| bettercmd.enable | Enables/Disables the mod | true    |


### betterconsolemc-commands_config.properties

```ini title="config/betterconsolemc-commands_config.properties"
[Command Mode] [Permissione Level] [Execution Timeout] [Broadcast To OP] [Ingame Command name] [command To execute]
```

:::note

If an error occurs while parsing the commands and/or there is a syntax error, the mod will automatically be disabled to prevent unwanted behavior.
