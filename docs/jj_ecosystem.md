# Jonas_Jones Ecosystem

The Ecosystem is a collection of many personal projects working together as a Network. This includes parts like the [API](/api) and [Blog](https://blog.jonasjones.dev).

It aims to join many of my own services into a single entity by hosting most of it on Cloudflare.

A very outdated roadmap is available on [Github](https://github.com/users/JonasunderscoreJones/projects/2)
